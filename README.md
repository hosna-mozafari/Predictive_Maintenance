# Predictive Maintenance Using NASA Dataset  

## ?? Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a **predictive maintenance** system using sensor data from the **NASA dataset**. The goal is to analyze machine performance and predict potential failures before they occur, improving industrial efficiency.  

## ?? Project Structure  
- **data/** ? Contains raw dataset files.  
- **notebooks/** ? Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development.  
- **scripts/** ? Python scripts for data processing and model training.  
- **my_project/** ? Virtual environment (dependencies).  

## ?? Steps Completed So Far  
? Set up the project structure.  
? Created a virtual environment (`my_project`).  
? Downloaded the NASA dataset.  
? Pushed the project to GitHub.  

## ?? Next Steps  
?? Load and analyze the dataset.  
?? Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
?? Preprocess the data and prepare it for machine learning.  

## ?? Dependencies  
To install required dependencies, activate the virtual environment and run:  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
