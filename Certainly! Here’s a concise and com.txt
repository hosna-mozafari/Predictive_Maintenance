### **Predictive Maintenance Dataset Summary**

This dataset consists of sensor readings and operational conditions from a fleet of **engines**. The objective is to **predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of each engine using the data collected during its operation.

#### **Key Components of the Dataset:**

1. **Unit Information:**
   - **unit_number**: Identifies each engine unit.
   - **time_in_cycles**: Represents the number of operational cycles completed by the engine. Each cycle can be thought of as a "unit of work" done by the engine, like a day of operation if it runs continuously.

2. **Operational Settings:**
   - The dataset includes 3 operational settings that define **how the engine is used**:
     - **operational_setting_1**: A control setting related to engine performance.
     - **operational_setting_2**: Another control variable affecting the engine's operational environment.
     - **operational_setting_3**: A third control variable.
   - These settings can vary, impacting engine behavior and wear.

3. **Sensors (21 Sensor Columns):**
   - The dataset contains **21 sensor readings** that measure **different aspects** of the engine’s performance, including temperature, pressure, vibration, and flow rates.
   - These sensors capture data on various **components of the engine** under different operational conditions (e.g., during high load, low load, or idle states).
   - Each sensor gives a reading that can change over time as the engine operates through its cycles.

4. **Remaining Useful Life (RUL):**
   - The **RUL** is calculated by subtracting the current **time_in_cycles** from the maximum cycles the engine is expected to run. It tells us how many cycles are left before the engine fails.

### **Data Usage:**

- The **sensor readings** (21 columns) and **operational settings** are used as **features** to predict the **RUL** of the engine.
- **RUL** is the **target variable** that we are trying to predict — essentially forecasting how many cycles are left before failure.

This dataset is perfect for building a **predictive maintenance model**, where the goal is to anticipate engine failures before they happen, improving efficiency and reducing downtime.
